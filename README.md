# New Years Predictions
_Note: Project is in Danish._

Simple webapp to display results from a quiz attempting to predict the outcome of 25 events in 2019.

The main purpose of the project was to get a chance to play around with Vue and Firebase.
As such there are many things that could definitely be improved upon like
* Adding tests
* Adding CI
* Adding an interface to input the answers instead of using the Firebase console
* Improve component separation
* Moving CSS to separate files and cleaning it up
* Dynamically loading language specific strings
* Better error handling
* ... and much more
